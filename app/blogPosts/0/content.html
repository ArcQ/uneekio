  Conventions are an important to society. At it’s core, it drives the rules that allow for large groups of human beings to live peacefully together. 
</p>

<p>
  But far too many of us blindly conform to conventional thinking like coded instructions. It’s often without reasone or thought, because it’s what we’re taught.
</p>

<p>
  Ask yourself, have you done anything that you didn’t know the reason to, but just because you were told to. 
</p>

<p>
  Did you go to college because your parents told you so?
</p>
<p>
  Did you get a job because your peers told you so?
</p>
<p>
  Did you eat a meal around dinner time because you felt it was right?
</p>
<p>
  I started a habit of questioning conventional thinking and I have found it directly responsible for a variety of success, over-achievements and a general self-fulfillment that I have not experienced before.

</p>
<p>Here are the top three reasons of why I think YOU should start questioning conventional thinking.
</p>
<h3><span class = "listNumber">1</span> Convention breeds mediocrity.</h3>
<p>
  Following convention can be simplified to doing what is normally accepted. We’re all taught at a young age to learn to stick in and not stick out. We all learn at a young age whether its through are parents, teachers or peers, that we need to stick in and not stick out. Being normal helps us get through the world.
</p>
<p>
  Wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Follow convention, stay ordinary and you will:
</p>
<p>
  one in two chance to get divorced(1),
</p>
<p>
  a two in one chance to hate your job(2)
</p>
<p> 
  a two in one chance to not have enough savings when you retire(3)
<p>
  In this world, those select few who hare rich are outnumbered by the number of the not so rich. It doesn’t only apply to money. No matter what your definition of success is, usually its a large number of unsuccessful that dream towards the few who are. 
</p>
<p>
  Don’t use this as a motivation to give up, use it as motivation to be different. To succeed means to be the ones that do things a little differently, you’d be surprised how far just a slight change in perception can take you.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re thinking “Its just how life is, not everyone can beat the odds and become the super rich.”, give me the chance to convince you otherwise in you are allowed to dream big before you continue.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at recent history, many of the most storied successes make very unconventional decisions. According to the Harvard Business Review, innovators of successful businesses spend almost 50% more time trying to think different compared to non-innovators(4). 
</p>
<p>
  Take some time to go through some biographies and you will quickly find yourself awed by the stories and decisions that some of these individuals took. 
</p>

<h3><span class = "listNumber">2</span> It helps you to do everything for a reason.</h3>
<p>
  I’m not telling you to simply live unconventionally, but rather to ask questions so that you can find the reason behind everything you do. 
</p>
<p>
  Knowing the reason behind the things you do allows you to rationally make decisions and benchmark it’s true benefit to you. Increase the efficiency of your day by weeding out the tasks that aren’t necessary. Successful people understand how valuable time is and they don’t waste it on anything that’s simply not worth it. 
</p>
<p>
  As an added benefit, research has shown that by simply learning the reason behind a particular action, your effectiveness in the task also increases. Intellect is human’s greatest weapon, so start maximizing the value your actions bring. 
</p>
<h3><span class = "listNumber">3</span> It will make your life more fulfilling.</h3>

<p>
  Some people I know deal with a lot of uncertainty when they think about happiness and fulfillment in their life. 
</p>

<p>
  Putting reason to your actions will make every task you accomplish become more purposeful. When you start rationally making efficient modifications to your day, you start realizing that writing that blog piece wasn’t a waste of time, or spending time with your friends at the bar wasn’t a waste of time. You’re simply adhering to the goals you’ve set for yourself. 
</p>

<p>
  You’ll find you’ll gain a confidence in your actions and actually spend less time regretting anything you do. Your days will pass by feeling more productive and meaningful. 
</p>

<p>
  By making simple changes to your perspective, you could be surprised at who much your life can really change and how much more success you can attain. 
</p>

<p>
  Just give it a try, next time someone tells you the right way to do something, ask yourself why? How much benefit does this really have for me? Is it really worth it? Could I be doing something better with my time?
