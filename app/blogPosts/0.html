<p>
  Conventions are important, without them, it would be hard for society and life around you to exist.
</p>

<p>
But are too many of us blindly conforming to conventional thinking like coded instructions? Ask yourself, have you done anything lately because its what you were taught to do?
</p>

<p>
Did you go to college because your parents told you so?
</p>

<p>
Did you eat a meal around dinner time because thats what you’ve done all your life?
</p>

<p>
Did you get your job because everyone else did?
</p>

<p>
I started a habit of questioning conventional thinking, and just this simple change in perspective has lead me to a variety of success, over-achievements and a general self-fulfillment that I have not experienced before.
</p>

<p>
Here are the top three reasons of why I think YOU should start questioning conventional thinking.

<h3><span class = "listNumber">1</span> Conventional Thinking Breeds Mediocrity</h3>
<p>
We’re all taught at a young age to fit in and not stick out. We all learn that being normal helps us get through life.</p>

<p>
  Wrong.
</p>
<p>
Follow convention, stay average and you have:

  a 50% chance to get divorced, <span class = "citeMark">1</span>
</p>
<p class = "emphasis">
  a 50% chance to hate your career, <span class = "citeMark">2</span>
</p>
<p class = "emphasis"> 
  a 2 to 1 chance to not have enough savings when you retire.<span class = "citeMark">3</span>
<p>
The important thing is that these aren’t facts, it’s simply the odds of a path that you may choose to take. My advice? Don’t give up and accept these odds, use it as motivation to be a little different.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of your definition of success, the successful are usually outnumbered by the vast majority who are unsuccessful. It applies to money, it applies to art, it applies to sports and whatever else comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
It makes sense, a vast majority of people who do everything the same ay have the same value in society as everyone else. The best opportunities are reserved to those who can provide additional value, the ones who always seem a little better.
</p>
<p>
But better is simply the wrong word. Sometimes, all it takes is to think a little differently. According to the Harvard Business Review, innovators of successful businesses spend almost 50% more time trying to think different compared to non-innovators <span class = "citeMark">4</span>. Look at recent history and  you’ll find that many of the most storied successes make very unconventional decisions.
</p>
<p>
Simply put, you can’t be extraordinary if you don’t stick out. Being normal simply puts you at the mean, It keeps you mediocre. Don’t stick in, stick out.
</p>

<h3><span class = "listNumber">2</span> It helps you to do everything for a reason.</h3>
<p>
  I’m not telling you to simply live unconventionally, but rather to ask questions so that you can find the reason behind everything you do. 
</p>
<p>
  Knowing the reason behind the things you do allows you to rationally make decisions and benchmark it’s true benefit to you. Increase the efficiency of your day by weeding out the tasks that aren’t necessary. Successful people understand how valuable time is and they don’t waste it on anything that’s simply not worth it. 
</p>
<p>
  As an added benefit, research has shown that by simply learning the reason behind a particular action, your effectiveness in the task also increases. Intellect is human’s greatest weapon, so start maximizing the value your actions bring. 
</p>
<h3><span class = "listNumber">3</span> It will make your life more fulfilling.</h3>

<p>
  Some people I know deal with a lot of uncertainty when they think about happiness and fulfillment in their life. 
</p>

<p>
  Putting reason to your actions will make every task you accomplish become more purposeful. When you start rationally making efficient modifications to your day, you start realizing that writing that blog piece wasn’t a waste of time, or spending time with your friends at the bar wasn’t a waste of time. You’re simply adhering to the goals you’ve set for yourself. 
</p>

<p>
  You’ll find you’ll gain a confidence in your actions and actually spend less time regretting anything you do. Your days will pass by feeling more productive and meaningful. 
</p>

<p>
  By making simple changes to your perspective, you could be surprised at who much your life can really change and how much more success you can attain. 
</p>

<p>
  Just give it a try, next time someone tells you the right way to do something, ask yourself why? How much benefit does this really have for me? Is it really worth it? Could I be doing something better with my time?
