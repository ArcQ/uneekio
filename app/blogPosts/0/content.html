<title>3 Compelling Reasons to Question Convention</title>
<meta name="description" content="There are a lot of blogs that rave about an unconventional life, but they don’t exactly hit the mark. The value lies in the question. Here are the top 3 reasons why I think questioning conventional thinking leads you to higher levels of success and happiness.">

<p>
It happens every single day of our life.
</p>

<p>
Directly or not, there’s always someone or something telling us what and how to do something.
</p>

<p>
The right way.
</p>

<p>
Eat 3 meals a day, go to college, get a job. The fact of the matter is that most people take this conventional path. And why not? If it works for all those other people, don’t fix what’s not broke!
</p>

<p>
  A few years back I experienced a life-changing failure. As an attempt to fix my life, I started a habit of questioning conventional thinking and evaluating things that people told me to do. I  credit the success I achieved afterwards with this simple change of perspective.
</p>

<p>
Here are the top three reasons of why I think questioning conventional thinking will lead you to higher levels of happiness and success.
</p>

<h3><span class = "listNumber">1</span> Convention makes your normal. </h3>

<p>
We’re all taught at a young age to fit in and not stick out. Getting through life is a lot easier when you’re considered normal.
</p>

<p>
Wrong.
</p>

<p>
How many times would employers hire the most normal applicants? How many times does the average employees get promoted? How many ordinary ideas become billion dollar valuations?
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your definition of success, the successful are usually outnumbered by the vast majority who are unsuccessful. Its a case of yin and yang. Without a vast majority of average people, there cannot exist the minority of exceptional.
</p>

<p>
In a world of limited opportunities, you simple can’t afford to do the same things that everybody else does. I’m not talking about achieving the exceptional. The facts show it, most of the vast majority that are average end up failing. As quoted, the average person has:
</p>

<p class = "emphasis">
  a 50% chance to get divorced, <span class = "citeMark">1</span>
</p>
<p class = "emphasis">
  a 50% chance to hate your career, <span class = "citeMark">2</span>
</p>
<p class = "emphasis"> 
  a 2 to 1 chance to not have enough savings when you retire.<span class = "citeMark">3</span>
<p>

<p>
Now if that’s not a high chance for failure, it may be time to re-adjust your standards. You can achieve much better odds than that.
</p>

<p>
I’m not telling you that you need to be exceptional. Rather, sometimes all it takes is to think a little differently. It’s about getting out of the majority, and a part of that means not doing things the same way everyone else is doing it.
</p>

<h3><span class = "listNumber">2</span> The value lies in the question. </h3>

<p>
It’s not simply about being unconventional. There are a lot of blogs that rave about an unconventional life, but they don’t exactly hit the mark either. Not all conventions are bad, it’s simply irrational to reject them all.
</p>

<p>
Rather I’m telling you to ask more questions. How does this really benefit me? What is the true value of doing it? Is it really worth my time?
</p>

<p>
Time is simply such a limiting factor in our lives that we really have to focus on being more efficient. Successful people understand how little time there really is, and there simply isn’t enough of it to waste on anything that’s simply not worth it. “Why spend 2 hours at the pub meeting with some old acquaintances if you really didn’t care to talk to them in the past two years?”
</p>

<p>
Discover the reason behind why you do certain things and benchmark it’s true benefit to you.Increase the efficiency of your day by weeding out the tasks that aren’t necessary. 
</p>

<p>
As an added benefit, research has shown that by simply learning the reason behind a particular action, your effectiveness in the task also increases. Intellect is human’s greatest weapon, so start maximizing the value your actions bring.
</p>

<h3><span class = "listNumber">2</span> It’ll truly make your life more fulfilling. </h3>

<p>
Many people struggle with high levels of uncertainty when they think about happiness and fulfillment in their life.
</p>

<p>
Putting reason to your actions will make every task you accomplish become more purposeful. When you start rationally improving your day, you start realizing that writing that blog piece or even spending time with your friends at the bar wasn’t a waste of time. You’re simply adhering to the goals you’ve set for yourself.
</p>

<p>
You'll gain confidence in your actions and actually spend less time regretting anything you do. Your days will pass by feeling more productive and meaningful.
</p>

<p>
By making simple changes to your perspective, you could be surprised at how much your life can really change and how much more success you can attain.
</p>

<p>
Just give it a try, next time someone tells you the right way to do something, ask yourself why? How much benefit does this really have for me? Is it really worth it? Could I be doing something better with my time?
